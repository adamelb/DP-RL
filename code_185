### Intraday Position Optimisation &nbsp;—&nbsp; Mathematical Formulation

---

#### 1. Notation  

| Symbol | Dimension | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| \(T\) | – | Remaining number of minutes in the trading day (≤ 390) |
| \(\alpha_i\) | \(T\) | “Alpha” signal at minute \(i\) |
| \(c_i\) | \(T\) (or scalar) | Transaction cost coefficient |
| \(\nu_i\) | \(T\) | Execution weight in the inventory dynamics |
| \(x_i\) | \(T\) | Trade executed at minute \(i\) (our **decision variable**) |
| \(y_i,\,w_i\) | \(T\!+\!1\) | Two *imbalance* states (after minute \(i\)) |
| \(K_1,K_2\) | – | Weights in the aggregated imbalance |
| \(\varphi_1,\varphi_2\) | – | Mean-reversion factors of the two imbalances |
| \(p\) | – | Current net position *before* minute 1 |
| \(y_0,w_0\) | – | Current values of the two imbalances |

---

#### 2. State dynamics  

\[
\begin{aligned}
y_i &= \varphi_1\,y_{i-1} + \nu_i\,x_i,\\[4pt]
w_i &= \varphi_2\,w_{i-1} + \nu_i\,x_i,\\[6pt]
z_i &= K_1\,y_i + K_2\,w_i
\end{aligned}
\qquad (i = 1,\dots,T)
\]

---

#### 3. Instantaneous reward  

\[
r_i(x_i) \;=\; \alpha_i\,x_i
 \;-\; c_i\,|x_i|
 \;-\; \operatorname{sign}(z_i)\,\sqrt{|z_i|}\;x_i .
\]

*The last term penalises trading **with** the prevailing imbalance.*

---

#### 4. Optimisation problem  

\[
\begin{aligned}
\max_{x_1,\dots,x_T}\;&\sum_{i=1}^{T} r_i(x_i)\\[6pt]
\text{s.t. }&\underbrace{p + \sum_{i=1}^{T} x_i}_{\text{end-of-day position}} = 0. \tag{Unwind constraint}
\end{aligned}
\]

The problem is **non-linear** (because of the square-root term) and **coupled over time**
(the imbalance \(z_i\) depends on all past trades).

---

#### 5. Lagrangian & marginal decision rule  

Introduce a Lagrange multiplier \(\mu\) for the unwind constraint:

\[
\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x},\mu)
 \;=\;
\sum_{i=1}^{T}\Bigl[
  \alpha_i x_i - c_i|x_i|
  - \operatorname{sign}(z_i)\sqrt{|z_i|}\,x_i
\Bigr]
\;+\;\mu\Bigl(p + \sum_{i=1}^{T} x_i\Bigr).
\]

For **fixed \(\mu\)** the term \(\alpha_i x_i\) becomes \((\alpha_i-\mu)x_i\).
If we *freeze* the feedback of \(x_i\) inside the square-root (reasonable for
small incremental trades) the sub-problem at each time / bucket is

\[
\max_{x}\;
(\alpha_i - \mu)\,x - c_i|x|
- \underbrace{\operatorname{sign}(\tilde z_i)\sqrt{|\tilde z_i|}\,x}_{\text{penalty with \(\tilde z_i\) fixed}}
\]

whose **closed-form optimum** is the classical *bang-bang* rule  

\[
x_i^{\star}(\mu)=
\begin{cases}
\phantom{-}\bigl[(\alpha_i-\mu)-c_i\bigr], & \alpha_i-\mu> c_i,\\[4pt]
-\bigl[(\alpha_i-\mu)+c_i\bigr], & \alpha_i-\mu<-c_i,\\[4pt]
0, & |\alpha_i-\mu|\le c_i.
\end{cases}
\]

(The square-root penalty is zero-gradient at the origin, so the
sign-switch thresholds stay at \(\pm c_i\).)

---

#### 6. Choosing \(\mu\) (bisection)  

Define  

\[
g(\mu)\;=\;p+\sum_{i=1}^{T}x_i^{\star}(\mu).
\]

- \(g(\mu)\) is **monotone decreasing** in \(\mu\).  
- The root \(g(\mu)=0\) is found by **bisection** (≈ 20–30 evaluations give machine precision).  
Each evaluation requires a single forward pass to update \((y_i,w_i,z_i)\).

---

#### 7. Bucketisation for speed  

To cut the dimensionality from \(T\) to \(T/B\):

1. Partition the horizon into buckets of length \(B\).  
2. Assume a **constant trade** \(x_g\) inside bucket \(g\).  
3. Use bucket-averaged coefficients  
\[
\bar\alpha_g=\frac1B\sum_{i\in g}\alpha_i,\quad
\bar c_g    =\frac1B\sum_{i\in g}c_i,\quad
\bar\nu_g   =\frac1B\sum_{i\in g}\nu_i.
\]
4. Run the same bisection on the reduced problem (typically
39 variables for \(B=10\) versus 390 originals).

The overall complexity is **\(O(T \log \varepsilon^{-1})\)** but with a very small
constant; on a modern CPU the full-day solution takes \< 1 ms,
hence suitable for per-minute re-optimisation.

---

#### 8. Live trading loop  

At each clock tick:

1. Shrink all vectors to the **remaining horizon** \(T\).  
2. Update current states \((p,y_0,w_0)\).  
3. Run the optimiser (bucket size e.g. \(B=10\)).  
4. Execute only the **first trade** \(x_1^{\star}\).  
5. Advance one minute and repeat.
